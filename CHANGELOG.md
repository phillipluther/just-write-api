Updates, feature additions/removals, and breaking changes for the `just-write-api`.


### 0.3.0 - February 6, 2018

**Features**

* Added Express Router capability to the API; can now be used without a stand-alone server and incorporated into existing Express apps

* Added an index file in the `lib/endpoints` directory so all endpoint request handlers can be imported at once

**Breaking Changes**

* Using the API programmatically now requires either a `server` or `endpointRouter` named import; command-line usage is not affected
